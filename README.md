# Java Scrabble Challenge


# 🅂🄲🅁🄰🄱🄱🄻🄴


## About the challenge
Using Java, build a simple scrabble program using functions, loops, and flow control

### Steps performed

1. Forked repository and then cloned my own copy:
2. Run the tests from IntelliJ. There were a number of ways to run the test suite:
   1. Right-click on the project and then select `Run all Tests`
   2. Right-click on the `ScrabbleTest` and click `Run ScrabbleTest`
   3. Open the class file `ScrabbleTest` and click the "Play" button to the left of the class declaration

3. In GitHub, opened a pull request from your forked repository to the challenge repository.
4. Implemented the criteria below locally and pushed my code to my repository.

## Task requirements

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

##### Letter Values

You'll need these:

| Letter                        | Value  |
| ----                          |  ----  |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T  |     1  |
| D, G                          |     2  |
| B, C, M, P                    |     3  |
| F, H, V, W, Y                 |     4  |
| K                             |     5  |
| J, X                          |     8  |
| Q, Z                          |     10 |

Example
"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

```
3 + 2x1 + 2x3 + 2 + 1
= 3 + 2 + 6 + 3
= 14
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```java

class ScrabbleRunner {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scrabble scrabble = new Scrabble("");
      scrabble.score();   // => 0

      scrabble = new Scrabble(null);
      scrabble.score();   // => 0

      scrabble = new Scrabble("a");
      scrabble.score(); // => 1

      scrabble = new Scrabble("f");
      scrabble.score(); // => 4

      scrabble = new Scrabble("street");
      scrabble.score(); // =>, 6

      scrabble = new Scrabble("quirky");
      scrabble.score(); // => 22

      scrabble = new Scrabble("OXYPHENBUTAZONE");
      scrabble.score(); // => 41
   }
}
```

## Extended Acceptance Criteria
> Each `Scrabble` method should be no more than 5 lines and contain no more than 5 operations.

> You can play a double or a triple letter.

> You can play a double or a triple word.

## Self-review
### What have I learnt
* Better grips with using Java and experimented with various concepts such as final keyword, overloading and enhanced for() loops etc.
* Performing test-driven development using the JUnit testing framework.
* Exploring with Hashmap to store key/value pairs.
### Areas to improve on
* Cutting down methods to no more than 5 lines & contain no more than 5 operations.
* Using domain modelling as part of test driven development.
